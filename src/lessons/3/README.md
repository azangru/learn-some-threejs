## Exercise
Create a polygon out of triangles. Based on:

and
- https://github.com/udacity/cs291/blob/master/unit2/polygon-creation.js
- https://github.com/udacity/cs291/blob/master/unit2/polygon-location.js
- https://github.com/udacity/cs291/blob/master/unit2/polygon-radius.js

This is an exercise on triangulation (tessellation). It is important to remember that a shape is considered to be on the "front side" if the vertices follow one another in the counterclockwise direction. If they follow in a clockwise direction, the shappe will be considered to be on the "back side", and will be invisible.
