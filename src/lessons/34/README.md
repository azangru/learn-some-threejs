- Problem: Specular Mapping in https://content.udacity-data.com/cs291/notes/UdacityLesson8TexturesandReflections.pdf
- Initial setup in https://github.com/udacity/cs291/blob/master/unit8/ps-specular-mapping.js

NOTE: using the teapot geometry from Three.js examples rather than the geometry provided in the Udacity repo (the teapot in the three.js repo must have been copied from Eric Haines's Udacity course)
