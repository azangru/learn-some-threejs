## Exercise
Build a simplified shape of a drinking bird model. This is an exercise on using basic geometric shapes, such as boxes, spheres, and cylinders — as well as positioning them in the canvas

Based on:
- problem 2.5 in https://content.udacity-data.com/cs291/notes/UdacityLesson2PointsVectorsandMeshes.pdf
- initial setup in https://github.com/udacity/cs291/blob/master/unit2/drinking-bird.js

Used THREE.AxesHelper to figure out the axes.
