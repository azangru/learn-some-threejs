## Exercise
Update a textured triangle to a textured square.

- Exercise: Make a Textured Square in https://content.udacity-data.com/cs291/notes/UdacityLesson8TexturesandReflections.pdf
- Initial setup in https://github.com/udacity/cs291/blob/master/unit8/05-textured-square.js


NOTE: had to use Three's BufferGeometry instead of the Geometry constructor that has been removed from the Three library. Thus, had to update the starter code.
