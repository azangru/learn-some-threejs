## Exercise
Build a stairway from the ground to the golden cup, given the initial two stairs. This is an exercise in 3d object positioning. 

Based on:
- problem 2.4 in https://content.udacity-data.com/cs291/notes/UdacityLesson2PointsVectorsandMeshes.pdf
- initial setup in https://github.com/udacity/cs291/blob/master/unit2/create-stairs.js

Updated syntax of the source code of the problem to modern standards. Also, migrated the code for the Coordinates visual helper; although I could have probably just used [THREE.AxesHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/helpers/AxesHelper)
